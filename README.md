Clean Architecture with Cubit
This repository contains a sample project showcasing the implementation of Clean Architecture using Cubit for state management in Flutter. Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that separates the concerns of the application into distinct layers, making the codebase more maintainable, testable, and scalable. Cubit is a popular state management library for Flutter applications, providing a reactive way to manage application state.

Features
Modular Structure: The project follows the Clean Architecture principles, dividing the codebase into layers: Presentation, Domain, and Data.
Cubit State Management: Utilizes the Cubit library to manage the state of the application, ensuring a predictable and maintainable state management approach.
Use Cases: Implements domain-specific use cases that encapsulate the business logic of the application.
Repository Pattern: Integrates the repository pattern to abstract data sources and provide a clean API for data access.
Dependency Injection: Uses dependency injection for decoupling modules and enabling easier unit testing.
Unit Testing: Includes unit tests for use cases, ensuring the correctness of business logic.
Clean UI: Provides a simple yet intuitive user interface following Material Design guidelines.
